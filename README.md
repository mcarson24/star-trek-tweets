Professional Trekspert Holly Amos rewatched all 726 Star Trek episodes and 13 movies in 2016.

Her live tweets of each episode included different factoids/behind-the-scenes information that are pretty interesting and made me want to re-watch the series myself.

She archived her tweets, but the Google Spreadsheet was ugly and a little hard to read so I did this because I was bored.

It doesn't look pretty, but is easier to navigate then the spreadsheet was.

It's currently sitting at https://star-trek-tweets.herokuapp.com/

It's probablty hibernating and may take a few seconds to wake up.

Use cmd/ctrl + f to search.

FUTURE: Will add search functionality.
